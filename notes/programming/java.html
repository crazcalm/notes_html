    <h1>Hello Java</h1>
    <h2>Java installation</h2>
    <p>I have no experience with Java, so I asked chatgpt how  should go about installing java on this window's machine. One of the options was an open source version of Java by <a href="https://adoptium.net/" target="_blank">Adoptium Temurin</a>. From them, I installed version 21 LTS.</p>

    <h2>Editors</h2>
    <p>I have horrible memories of me trying to reason my way around Java file structure in Vim, so I decided to install <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">eclipse</a>. I walked through a hello world tutorial to make sure everything was setup correctly (<a href="https://www.codejava.net/ides/eclipse/how-to-create-build-and-run-a-java-hello-world-program-with-eclipse" target="_blank">tutorial</a>).</p>
