    <h1>Node</h1>
    <h2>Version Manager</h2>
    <p>I just installed node on my window's machine and they recommended using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm" target="_blank">fnm</a>. I've never heard of this tool, but it seems like it is written in Rust.</p>
    <p>There was not issue intalling node and npm, but I had to manually add it to my path.</p>
