    <h1>Windows notes</h1>
    <p>I am not sure, but I think that I want to get better at frontend development and I currently think that taking my notes in html will help. Anyway, I have recently started using the windows side of my computer and all of this is so new to me that I need to take notes.</p>

    <h2>Powershell</h2>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>Here is a link to their top level <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/" target="_blank">docs</a></p>

    <h2>Terminal</h2>
    <h3>Package Manager</h3>
    <p>Window's now has a native package manager! Its called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/" target="_blank">winget</a>. It is a little akward to use, but it does the thing, so it's good enough for me.</p>

    <h3>Window Panels</h3>
    <p>There is not tmux or screen alternative that I can use locally, but the terminal window does allow us to split it into window panes. The functionality seems pretty basic, but it is better than nothing. See the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/panes" target="_blank">docs</a></p>

    <h3>Adding Environment Variables to the PATH</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to do it is via the GUI.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to your Window's search and look up "Environemt variables".</li>
        <li>The Environment Variables settings page will pop up.</li>
        <li>Find the User Environment Variable section and update the PATH.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It should be noted that the deliminator (in the GUI) for the paths in the PATH are new lines. So it is easy to add an entry, but it did feel weird to do...</p>

    <h3>Where do my programs get installed?</h3>
    <p>It looks like everything I install gets installed somewhere under <code>C:\Users\crazcalm\AppData</code> directory.</p>
