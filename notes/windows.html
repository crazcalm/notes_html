    <h1>Windows notes</h1>
    <p>I am not sure, but I think that I want to get better at frontend development and I currently think that taking my notes in html will help. Anyway, I have recently started using the windows side of my computer and all of this is so new to me that I need to take notes.</p>

    <h2>Powershell</h2>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>Here is a link to their top level <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/" target="_blank">docs</a></p>

    <h2>Terminal</h2>
    <h3>Package Manager</h3>
    <p>Window's now has a native package manager! Its called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/" target="_blank">winget</a>. It is a little akward to use, but it does the thing, so it's good enough for me.</p>

    <h3>Window Panels</h3>
    <p>There is not tmux or screen alternative that I can use locally, but the terminal window does allow us to split it into window panes. The functionality seems pretty basic, but it is better than nothing. See the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/panes" target="_blank">docs</a></p>
